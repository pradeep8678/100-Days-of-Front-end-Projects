    <h1>Some Cool Stories</h1>
    <div class="flex-columns">
      <p>The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona: Every July, the city of Pamplona in northern Spain hosts the San Fermín festival, famous for the Running of the Bulls. Dating back to the 14th century, this tradition sees brave (or perhaps foolhardy) participants running ahead of a group of charging bulls through the narrow streets of the city. The event draws thrill-seekers from around the world who come to test their mettle and experience the adrenaline rush of running alongside these massive animals. While it's undoubtedly a dangerous pursuit, it's also a cultural spectacle that symbolizes bravery and tradition in Spanish culture.

        <p>The Legend of El Cid: Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, was a legendary Spanish knight and military leader who lived during the 11th century. El Cid's exploits are the stuff of legend, and his story has been immortalized in countless poems, plays, and films. One of the most famous episodes in his life is his exile from the kingdom of Castile, during which he fought as a mercenary for both Christian and Muslim rulers in Spain. Despite facing numerous challenges and betrayals, El Cid remained a symbol of honor and loyalty, and his legacy continues to inspire generations of Spaniards.</p>
          <p>The Construction of La Sagrada Família: Perhaps one of the most remarkable architectural stories in Spain is the ongoing construction of the Sagrada Família basilica in Barcelona. Designed by the renowned architect Antoni Gaudí, construction began in 1882 and is still ongoing today, more than a century later. Gaudí devoted the last years of his life to the project, and his distinctive style is evident in every aspect of the basilica's design. The building's intricate facades, towering spires, and organic forms make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of Barcelona's most iconic landmarks. Despite the lengthy construction process, the Sagrada Família continues to captivate visitors with its beauty and symbolism, embodying the enduring spirit of creativity and perseverance.</p>
